    "reasoning_analysis": "Hi there! Thanks for providing that information. Now, let's focus on your swollen arm. To understand the situation better, could you tell me:\n\n*   When did you first notice the swelling in your arm?\n*   Is the swelling in one arm or both?\n*   Can you describe the location of the swelling? Is it in your entire arm, or just a specific part like your wrist, elbow, or hand?\n*   Have you experienced any injury or trauma to your arm recently?\n*   Is the swelling constant, or does it come and go?\n*   Do you have any pain, redness, warmth, or tenderness in the swollen area?\n*   Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as fever, itching, numbness, tingling, or difficulty moving your arm?\n*   Do you have any known allergies or medical conditions?\n\nPossible symptoms associated with a swollen arm could include:\n\n*   **Lymphedema:** Blockage in the lymphatic system, often causing swelling in one arm or leg.\n*   **Edema:** Fluid retention due to various factors like heart failure, kidney problems, or prolonged standing.\n*   **Injury:** Sprains, strains, fractures, or dislocations can cause swelling.\n*   **Infection:** Cellulitis or other infections can lead to swelling, redness, and pain.\n*   **Blood clot:** Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the arm can cause swelling and pain.\n*   **Allergic reaction:** Exposure to allergens can cause localized swelling.\n\nBased on your answers, I can provide some preliminary medical reasoning. For example, if you experienced a recent injury, the swelling is likely due to tissue damage and inflammation. If you have a history of heart problems, the swelling could be related to fluid retention. If the swelling is accompanied by redness and warmth, it could indicate an infection.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that I am an AI assistant, and this information is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Please consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. They may conduct a physical examination, order imaging tests (like X-rays or ultrasound), or perform blood tests to determine the underlying cause of your swollen arm.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try the following at-home measures to relieve the swelling:\n\n*   Elevate your arm above your heart level.\n*   Apply a cold compress to the swollen area for 15-20 minutes at a time.\n*   Avoid wearing tight clothing or jewelry on your arm.\n*   Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.\n\nProviding more detailed information about your symptoms will help me give you a more relevant preliminary analysis. Please keep me updated on any new developments or changes in your condition.",
